# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Project
Companies that involve a lot of transactions with the use of cards need to find anomalies in the system. The project aims to build a fraud detection model on credit cards. We will use the transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud to detect if new transactions made from the customer are fraud or not.
